Hello,

I'm David Freitag.

I am currently a **Data Engineer** at **American Family Insurance.** Prior to this, I was a Data Science Intern at Pitney Bowes, and I graduated from Baruch College with a master's degree in Information Systems/Data Analytics in May 2021. Before entering the field of data science and engineering, I worked in marketing, customer success, and K-12 education.
